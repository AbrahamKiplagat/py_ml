# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Classifier Comparison

This project compares the performance of various machine learning classifiers on a dataset. It provides a clean and modular structure for training, testing, and evaluating models such as:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree


# ðŸ“Š Output Example

The script prints accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each classifier:
SVM - Accuracy: 0.9333
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
         0       1.00      0.90      0.95        10
         1       0.88      1.00      0.93         7
# ðŸ§  Goals
Provide a starter framework for evaluating multiple classifiers.

Serve as a learning tool for beginners in machine learning.

Make model swapping and experimentation easy and modular.
